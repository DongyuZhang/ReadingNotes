# Meaningful Names

I think the best way to learn this is to illustrate different bad code example that you may write and be aware of that they are not good. And by correcting them, you will master the art of naming.

## Bad Name Examples
```java
int d; //elapsed time in days
int accountList;
int o = 0, O = 1, l = 2;
for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++)
	a2[i] = a1[i];
getActiveAccount();
getActiveAccountInfo();
private Date modymdhms;
for (int j = 0; j < 34; j++)
	s += (t[j]*4)/5;
PhoneNumber phoneString;
private String m_dsc;
class AddressData{}
void whack(){}
class AccountService{}
class AddressManager{}
class Account{
	String accountName;
	String accountZipCode;
	String accountAddress;
}
```
```java
private void printEventLog(char candidate, int count) {
	Sting number;
	String verb;
	if (count == 0) {
		number = "no";
		verb = "are";
	} else if (count == 1) {
		number = "1";
		verb = "is";
	} else {
		number = Integer.toString(count);
		verb = "are";
	}
	String logMessage = String.format(
		"There %s %s %s", verb, number, candidate
	);
	print(logMessage);
}
```
Use Intention-Revealing Names
Avoid disinformation
Make Meaningful Distinction
Use Pronounceable Names
Use Searchable Names
Pick One Word per concept
Add meaningful context
Don't add gratuitous context
Class Name should have noun or noun phrase. It should not be a verb.
Method Names should have verb or verb phrase.
When constructors are overloaded, use static factory method with names that describe the arguments is better.
```java
Complex fulcurumPoint = Complect.FromRealNumber(23.0);
```
