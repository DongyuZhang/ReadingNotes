# Error Handling

* Use Exceptions rather than return error codes.
* Write your try-catch-finally statement first.
* Provide Context with Exceptions: each exception should provide enough context to determine the source and location and type of an error.
* Use different Exceptions only when you want one to be caught and the other one to pass through.
* Don't return null
* Don't pass null
### Unchecked Exceptions
Use unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions violate Open-Close principle. For example, you throw a checked exception from a method in your code and the catch is three levels above, you must declare that exception in the signature of each method between you and the catch.

Checked exceptions can sometimes be useful if you are writing a critical library: you must catch them. But in general application development the dependency costs outweigh the benefits.

Example:
```java
public void a() throws Exception{}
// if a is changed to throw exception, all functions that call a should be modified
public void b(){ a(); }
```
### Define normal flow
**_Don't let your specific case increase your code complexity_**

Example:
```java
try{
	MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getId());
	total += expenses.getTotal();
} catch (MealExpensesNotFound e) {
	total += getMealPerDiem();
}
```
We can make the code cleaner like this:
```java
public class PerDiemMealExpenses implements MealExpenses {
	public int getTotal(){//return the per diem default}
}
public class expenseReportDAO {
	public MealExpenses getMeals(int employeeId) {
		if(no meal expenses) {
			return new PerDiemMealExpenses();
		}
	}
}
MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getId());
total += expenses.getTotal();
```
