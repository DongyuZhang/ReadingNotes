# Formatting
## How large should a source file be?
Try to limit numbers of lines of code less than 500.

## Better Practice
* Make Vertical Openness between concepts. Or make the functions share similar operations or names closer.
* Make the functions that have a relationship closer. Make the caller at the top and the called function at the bottom.
* Give appropriate spaces to get horizontal openness. Example: 
``` java
return b*b – 4*a*c;
```
* Doing horizontal alignment sometimes is a waste of time (align variable type or name). Example:
```java
String name = "donny";
int	   age  = "21";
```
* Always do an indentation is better than to put a lot of code in one line. Example:
```java
// bad
if (age < ADULT_AGE) reject();
```
* If you’re in a team, use the same formatting within the whole team.
