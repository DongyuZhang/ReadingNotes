If you yourself want to become a better programmer, his book is a good source for you! However, the truth is 

**You will not get anything from your company if you write cleaner code**. 

Then you need a reason for learning cleaner code. To be honest, it's so hard for me to come up with one, and here is one for you: 

**Good code style can make coding more effecient and cause less bugs in your code**

## Craftsmanship
There are 2 parts to learn craftsmanship: _knowledge_ and _work_.
Learning to write clean code is more like learning to ride a bike. Even though you know the principles to ride, the first time you do, you probably fail. You must practive it yourself and watch yourself fail and gain the knowledge and master it.

## There will be code
We will never be rid of code because code represents the detail of the requirements. We are hoping that one day we will discover a way to create a machine that can do what we want rather than what we say. That can never happen. Code is the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. We will never eliminate necessary precision. So, there will always be code.

## The Boy Scout Rule

**_Leave the campground cleaner than you found it_**

If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code will not rot. Change one variable name for the better, break up one function that’s a little too large, eliminate one small bit of duplication, clean up one composite if statement.

## Small Joke
A concert violinist who got lost on his way to a performance, he stopped an old man on the corner and asked him how to get to Carnegie Hall. The old man looked at the violinist and the violin tucked under his arm, and said:” Practice, son. Practice!”
