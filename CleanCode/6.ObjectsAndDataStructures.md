# Objects and Data Structures
* Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. Data structure expose their data and have no meaningful functions. The concepts are virtual opposites.
* Procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. OO code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change.

## The law of Demeter

**_A module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates._**

The method should not invoke methods on objects that are return by any of the allowed functions. If it takes more than 2 hops to access an object from an object, consider refactor your code.

Do not do the hybrids of objects and data structures. For example, a class that have functions that do significant things, and that also have either public variables or public accessors and mutators that make the private variables public, temping other external functions to use those variables the way a procedural program would use a data structure.

In any given system we will sometimes want the flexibility to add new data types and so we prefer objects for that part of the system. Other times we will want the flexibility to add new behaviors and so in that part of the system we prefer data types and procedures. Good software developers understand these issues without prejudice and choose the approach that is best for the job at hand.
