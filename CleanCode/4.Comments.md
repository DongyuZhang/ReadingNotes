# Comments
Don’t comment bad code – rewrite it.
Try your best to get rid of comments. Explain yourself in code.
Don’t use a comment when you can use a function or a variable.

## Good Comments (sometimes):
### Legal Comments
Sometimes corporate coding standards force us to write.
### Explanation of Intent
Sometime comments provide the intent behind a decision. You may not agree with the programmer’s decision but at least, you know what he was trying to do. 
### Warning of consequences
Put the comments at the top of a function to warn other programmers some consequences of this function.
### TODO Comments
TODOs are jobs that the programmer think should be done, but for some reason can’t do now. But it is never an excuse to leave bad code in the system.
### Amplification
A comment can be used to amplify the importance of something that may otherwise seem inconsequential.
